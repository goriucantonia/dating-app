# PICKUP

The one document that tells someone with no memory of the last session where this project actually is. Maintained per `development_principles.md` §24, as part of the work — never as a task afterwards.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01 · **Updated because:** the owner supplied both API keys, and **Step 2 is now done and witnessed** — all six acceptance criteria observed against real providers, owed measurement O-5 closed and deleted. Two forced provisional-model revisions recorded (see below).

---

## Read this first (30 seconds)

**Steps 1, 2, and 3 are done and witnessed** (one owed item left: O-4, the native desktop run). Both API keys are in `.env` (git-ignored). The owner's standing directive (2026-09-01): the priority is API calls that **connect, route correctly, and return simple valid responses** — complex architecture, advanced prompting, and model-tier upgrades are decided later, not now.

**Step 2, witnessed today with real keys:** `probe_structured_guard.py` GREEN against the live model (3 malformed attempts → repair prompts → typed give-up carrying raw output, no silent default); `probe_ai_smoke.py` GREEN (google generate `'ready'`, native-mode structured dict, 768-dim embedding, openrouter generate through a free model); a config-only model swap observed changing the logged model (AC4); and a real 429 observed being retried with backoff (`ai_call_retry` ×2, honoring retry-after) then surfacing as `RateLimitedError` (AC6).

**Forced revisions, dated inline where the decisions stood (§23):**
- Embedding pin `text-embedding-004` → **`gemini-embedding-001`** — Google withdrew the old model (API 404). 768 dims requested explicitly (its default is 3072) to match `vector(768)`; vectors L2-normalized by the provider. Zero vectors existed, so the swap cost nothing. Recorded in `ai_interaction.md` §3 and `config/ai.yaml`.
- Provisional google chat model `gemini-2.5-flash` → **`gemini-3.6-flash`** — the API rejected 2.5 as unavailable to new users. Still provisional; final choice belongs to the gates.

**Next: Step 4 — Accounts** (registration, login, `/me`, Flutter auth flow).

## Current state — honest

| Area | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Step 1 stack | **Witnessed** (2026-09-01): cold up → DB-connected 200; second down/up; topology; envelope; failure path | Prior session, git history |
| Step 2 `app/ai/` layer | **Witnessed** (2026-09-01, with real keys): both providers generate; native structured returns a valid dict; embedding 768-dim; guard probe GREEN; config-only model swap observed; 429 → backoff → typed error observed | Probe verdicts + `ai_call`/`ai_call_retry` log lines this session |
| Step 3 schema | **Witnessed** — migration `0002`: users, traits, questions, answers, trait_events, profile_embeddings (two-vector form), all CHECKs proven by rejected inserts, vector(768) dimension enforced | This session's psql output |
| Step 3 reconciliation | **Witnessed** — boot 1: 35 seeded (codes logged); boot 2: no-op; deleted PQ17 restored by name on boot 3; management script `scripts/run_reconcile.py` runs the same pass | api logs |
| Seed fidelity | **Witnessed** — `scripts/check_question_seeds.py` GREEN: plan ↔ `seeds/questions.yaml` ↔ DB identical, 35 questions | script verdict |
| Unit tests | **11 pass** in-container (8 guard/router + 3 traits_hash) | pytest output |
| Lint / build | ruff clean; image rebuilt green after D-004 editable-install fix | in-container runs |
| Remotes | All three repos pushed to GitHub (superproject `dating-app`, `dating-app-server`, `dating-app-ux`) | push output 2026-09-01 |

## What was just finished (Step 3, all tickets)

- **S3-B1/B2:** migration `0002` — the A3 DDL verbatim, with `traits` created before `questions` (the document's forward reference is a spec, not an execution order) and one `op.execute` per statement (asyncpg cannot prepare multi-command SQL). `profile_embeddings` is the revised two-vector form only.
- **S3-B3:** `app/models.py` — six async models mirroring the DDL one-to-one, Text + CHECK (named trade), pgvector `Vector(768)`. Alembic `env.py` now targets `Base.metadata`.
- **S3-B4:** `seeds/questions.yaml` **generated verbatim** from the module plan by `scripts/check_question_seeds.py --write` (no hand transcription — that is how a curly apostrophe silently becomes straight). Checker mode is the AC6 witness. Baseline probe_area mapping recorded in the script: BQ1=interests, BQ2=partner_criteria, BQ3/BQ4=situational, BQ5=self_image (routine call, §25 — BQ4's primary framing is situational; the pool carries six dedicated conversational questions).
- **S3-B5/B6:** `app/reconcile.py` — step 1 of the four-step pass (insert missing / repair drifted fields with a per-field log / count correct), wired into lifespan and invocable via `scripts/run_reconcile.py`.
- **S3-B7:** `app/traits_hash.py` — deterministic SHA-256 over the non-retracted trait rows (id, category, label, description, status, confidence), sorted by id. All-`keep` leaves it untouched; a retraction changes it. Unit-tested.
- **D-004 found and closed:** the image's baked site-packages copy of `app` shadowed the bind-mounted live code for `python scripts/…` entry points. Dockerfile now uninstalls the copy and does `pip install --no-deps -e .` — one authoritative code location. Both a script and a probe re-witnessed importing live code.

## What is next

**Step 4 — Accounts** (S4-B1…B5, S4-U1…U7): registration with the exact A1 form, login → JWT, `GET`/`PATCH /me`, the Flutter auth screens + the single 401 interceptor + router guards. `DELETE /me` is deliberately Step 15.

Useful facts for later steps, learned witnessing Step 2:
- `gemini-3.6-flash` is a **thinking model** — a tight `max_tokens` gets eaten by reasoning and yields `MAX_TOKENS` with no text. Give generous budgets.
- Free OpenRouter models 429 by congestion, per model. `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning:free` worked; `z-ai/glm-5.2:free` was saturated (and its content includes visible reasoning text). The `free-model-of-choice` slots remain unfilled — these are probe arguments, not choices.
- The google embedding free tier has a low per-minute cap — batch embed calls, don't loop them.

## Blocked, and on whom

| Item | Blocked on | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Native desktop witness (O-4) | **Owner:** enable Windows Developer Mode, then `flutter run -d windows` in `ux\` | Unchanged from last session |
| OpenRouter `free-model-of-choice` slots | **Owner decision, deferred by design** | Probe takes a model as an argument precisely so the slots stay unfilled |
| Paid-balance question | **Owner**, from the quota-fit numbers | Unchanged |
| Hosting / CORS / auth posture | **Owner, explicitly deferred** | Unchanged (decision log #11) |

## Traps that will bite you resuming cold

1. **Three git repositories.** Submodule commit(s) first, then the superproject pointer bump. An un-bumped pointer serves yesterday's code with today's specs.
2. **`docker compose down`/`up` is NOT a cold start** — the `db_data` volume survives. True cold = `down -v`.
3. **Flutter is not on PATH**: use `C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter.bat` (SDK installed 2026-09-01). Android SDK absent; targets are web and (after Developer Mode) Windows desktop.
4. **`.env` holds the DB password the volume was initialized with** — regenerate both together or neither.
5. **The `questions` table has a forward reference** (`module_1_data_collection.md` A3): create `traits` before `questions`, or add the FK after both exist.
6. **`profile_embeddings`: build the two-vector form** (`kind IN ('identity','preference')`, PK `(user_id, kind)`) — the revised copy, restated in `candidate_matching.md` §3.
7. **Editing `.env` does not reach a running container** — compose reads it at container start; `docker compose up -d` / restart after key changes.
8. **`ai_routes_unresolved` + two `provider_built … api_key_present: false` warnings at boot are correct behaviour**, not bugs — they disappear only when the owner supplies keys and fills slots.
9. **The 200-character minimum applies to dispute answers too** (§18); **dispute questions are outside pool progress** (§13).
10. **Calibration chat and match chat share a widget but differ** in flagging/metadata rules (§13).
11. **Load-bearing orderings** (§19): checkpoint before advancing; counts before cascade; validate before repair; `traits_hash` only after the trait write commits.
12. **An all-`keep` extraction run leaves everything fresh** (A5.1); **the 30-message cap counts environment rows** (§18).
13. **Ruff's `EXE002` is suppressed on purpose** — through the Windows bind mount every file looks executable; do not "fix" it by chmod.
14. **Decided things stay decided** (§23).

## Owed measurements (§4)

| # | Owed | Incurred at | Closed by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| O-1 | `opt_in` observed changing pool membership | Step 4 | Step 9 AC4 | **Anticipated** |
| O-2 | Pinned-snapshot assertion in `probe_answer_edit.py` | Step 6 | Step 9 (S9-P2) | **Anticipated** |
| O-3 | Matching vs properly seeded demo profiles | Step 9 | Step 15 | **Anticipated** |
| O-4 | Native (Windows) run rendering `/health` | Step 1, 2026-09-01 | Owner: Developer Mode + `flutter run -d windows` | **Owed** |

*(O-5 — the Step 2 live-call ACs — was closed 2026-09-01 and deleted per the queue rule: keys arrived, both probes ran GREEN, the config-only model swap and the 429→backoff→typed-error path were both observed in the logs.)*

## Probe status (§2)

| Probe | Status |
|---|---|
| `probe_structured_guard.py` | **GREEN** (2026-09-01, google/gemini-3.6-flash) |
| `probe_ai_smoke.py` (helper, not in the §2 minimum set) | **GREEN** (2026-09-01; openrouter model passed as argument) |
| All others (`pool_expansion`, `answer_edit`, `onboarding`, `matching_filters`, `simulation_resume`, `judge`, `deletion`, `demo_seeding`) | Not written — delivered in Steps 5–15 |
